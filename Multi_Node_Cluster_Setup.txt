Hadoop Installation Pre-Requisites
Below are the pre-requisites for installing Hadoop:

1. Node Preparation
2. Linux VM Instance
3. JDK 1.8 installed




Node Preparation

I am going to do installation on 6 nodes, below are the different catagories of nodes, I am going to use.

Type	          Count
Management Node	   1
Master Node	   2
Slave Nodes	   2




Management Node : 
Consists of Mangement services like host/event/
Cloudera Manager will be installed on it
Admins will have access to this node for management

Master Nodes :
Master services will be installed on this node
Hdfs/Yarn
It will be memory and code rich node


Slave Nodes :
Slave services like DataNode, NodeManagers zookeepers etc
they should be high on storage side
Average memory/CPU cores




cm.asia-south2-a.c.adroit-resolver-413814.internal
nn.asia-south2-a.c.adroit-resolver-413814.internal
snn.asia-south1-c.c.adroit-resolver-413814.internal
dn1.us-central1-a.c.adroit-resolver-413814.internal
dn2.us-central1-a.c.adroit-resolver-413814.internal

----------------------------------------------
Make the connectivity on all nodes

#Switch to root user > reset password
sudo passwd root

#Generate key for root user on all nodes
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

#Create Authrized file 
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

#Edit Authrozed file : copy all the other server pub key in rest servers so it can help for doing ssh 



# Edit sshd_config file & set below parameter
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	PermitRootLogin yes
	PasswordAuthentication yes
	#PermitEmptyPasswords no
	#PasswordAuthentication no


# Restart the sshd service
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service


---------------------------------------------
Install JDK 

JDK 8 is needed on the Linux Machine. Below are the steps for installing oracle java:

Install java 8 as the root user


#Check if Java Installed
java -version

#Install OpenJDK 8 JDK if no result found , once done check again Java version

To install OpenJDK 8 JDK using yum, run this command:
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y
 
#Set JAVA_HOME variable : Please specify the path of JAVA_HOME as per your version.

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk
echo $JAVA_HOME

---------------------------------------------------

Disable IPV6
Edit file /etc/sysctl.conf - vi /etc/sysctl.conf
Add the following lines:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
Execute the following command to reflect the changes.


------------------------------------------------
sysctl -p


Selinux
Just ensure that selinux should be disabled so that it cant impact Hadoop performance.

sudo setenforce 0
To disable it permanently

edit /etc/selinux/config

SELINUX=disabled
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
SETLOCALDEFS=0
---------------------------------------------------

Transparent Huge Page Compaction

# Check Transparent Huge Page Compaction is enabled

cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

#If it is enable then follow below step : 

sudo sed -i '/exit 0/d' /etc/rc.local

sudo su -c 'cat >>/etc/rc.local <<EOL
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
fi
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag; then
   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag 
fi
exit 0
EOL'

sudo -i source /etc/rc.local

cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
---------------------------------------------------------------
# Set Swappiness
sudo sysctl -a | grep vm.swappiness
sudo su -c 'cat >>/etc/sysctl.conf <<EOL
'vm.swappiness=0'
EOL'
sudo sysctl -p

------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure NTP 
timedatectl status

timedatectl list-timezones | grep Asia/Kolkata

sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata >> If Asia time is not set

timedatectl status


-------------------------------------------------------

#Install locate to find any file/directory

sudo yum install mlocate
sudo updatedb
locate bash_completion.sh
locate -b '\bash_completion.sh'

---------------------------------------------------------------

CM Installation 

#Install wget 
yum install wget

#Install CM : Validate URL if file is present 
wget  https://archive.cloudera.com/cm7/7.1.4/cloudera-manager-installer.bin	


chmod u+x cloudera-manager-installer.bin

sudo ./cloudera-manager-installer.bin 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Create GCP Instance
•	Go to the VM instances
•	Select your project and click Continue.
•	Click the Create instance button
•	Specify a Name for your first instance “cm”.
•	Change the Zone for this instance “asia-south-1-a“ (best is to choose closest to your location).
•	Select a Machine type for your instance.
•	In the Boot disk section, click Change to configure your boot disk.
•	In the OS images tab, choose an “CentOS 7” image.

Note: If it’s not running then execute the below command to run the cloudera-scm-server
sudo systemctl start cloudera-scm-server

•	In a web browser, go to http://<server_host>:7180, where <server_host> is the FQDN or IP address of the host where the Cloudera Manager Server is running.
Note: If “Unable to Connect” message appears, it means that the Cloudera Manager server has not yet fully started. 
Log into Cloudera Manager Admin Console. 
The default credentials are:
Username: admin Password: admin


On the Select Edition page, you can select the edition of Cloudera Manager to install and, optionally, install a license:

  Cloudera Data Platform - Data Center Edition Trial, which does not require a license file, but expires after 60 days.
2.Cloudera Data Platform Data Center Edition
  If you choose the CDP Data Center Edition Trial, you can upgrade the license at a later time.
3.Accept the License
4.Click Continue to proceed with the installation

The Cluster Basics page allows you to specify the Cluster Name.
Enter a cluster name and then click Continue.

1.The “Specify hosts” page appears. Type the hostnames of a machine: and Click Search.
2.Click Continue


Select Repository
The Select Repository page allows you to specify repositories for Cloudera Manager Agent and CDH and other software.
In the Cloudera Manager Agent section:
1.Select either Public Cloudera Repository or Custom Repository for the Cloudera Manager Agent software.
2.If you select Custom Repository, do not include the operating system-specific paths in the URL. For instructions on setting up a custom repository, see Configuring a Local Package Repository.


Accept JDK License
Select Install a system-provided version of OpenJDK
Click Continue.


Enter Login Credentials
Select Another user and enter the username for an account that has password-less sudo privileges.
Another user: root
Password: 
Click Continue.


Install Agents
The Install Agents page displays the progress of the installation. You can click on the Details link for any host to view the installation log. If the installation is stalled, you can click the Abort Installation button to cancel the installation and then view the installation logs to troubleshoot the problem.
If the installation fails on any hosts, you can click the Retry Failed Hosts to retry all failed hosts, or you can click the Retry link on a specific host.
After installing the Cloudera Manager Agent on all hosts, click Continue.

After the installation is complete, click Continue.
Inspect Cluster
The Inspect Cluster page provides a tool for inspecting network performance as well as the Host Inspector to search for common configuration problems. Cloudera recommends that you run the inspectors sequentially:
1. Run the Inspect Network Performance tool.
2. After the network inspector completes, click Show Inspector Results to view the results in a new tab.
3. Address any reported issues, and click Run Again (if applicable).
4. Click Inspect Hosts to run the Host Inspector utility.
